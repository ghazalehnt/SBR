      "What a great book! This book has all the feels and I found myself needing tissues at times. Indigo and Kai's story was so well written. Kai is Indigo's twin brothers best friend. Kai is dealing with family issues and finds friendship with indigo. Both characters deal with emotional and mental health issues. While trying to work through their issues, they find a common interest in art. This book delves into some intense emotional and mental health issues. A M Johnson does a wonderful job writing about such issues in a very caring, knowledgeable way.,Very hot dark erotic book. I am so enjoying the story and was glad to learn more about Lachlan and Jon's background. Hoping the next book will give more details on Shae's background.,Wow, what a way to end a series! I just can't say enough about this series and especially Thick. The FFMC books just got better and better with each one. Thick, where to begin, this book had me laughing on one page and crying on the next. It is a story only Scott Hildreth could write. I loved the wait for the 85%, and a quote I have lived by for years was included, \"Everything that's meant to be, will be.\" It's a story within a story about the end of a story. Scott Hildreth saved the best for last and what a book to end with. An absolute must read.,Celia Aaron is one of those automatic 1-click authors for me whether it be her dark or contemporary romances, fantasy or short stories. This book is no exception! Arabelle, a small town detectives, finds herself plunged into several murder cases that somehow have a connection. While Benton King, the eldest child of the first murder victim, thrusts himself into the middle of the investigation. Together they set out to solve the murders. The Elder is full of mystery, intrigue and suspense, some humor and love. It has it all! If you like who done it books then you will love this one. It will keep you guessing and you will not be able to turn the page fast enough!,I enjoyed reading this book very much. MC is my favorite genre and I can honestly say I have never read a non fiction MC story. That being said, this book sucked me in from the very beginning. The law enforcement officer, William Queen did an excellent job of infiltrating and gathering evidence needed to take down some of the Mongols. But in the two years it took to accomplish that, Billy St. John discovered many things about loyalty and the brotherhood of the country's most notorious MC club. The emotional strain of this assignment was interesting to read about. I laughed and cried and could not turn the pages fast enough.,Wow, I finished this book a few days ago and it took me that long to gather my thoughts. What an amazing book this was. It had all the feels! I give Zane and Jenna 5 stars each for having the courage to put their story out there for the world to read. I have to admit, I did not like Zane or Chad very much throughout this book and had the utmost respect for Jenna and Melissa. As the story progressed and more was revealed my feelings towards Zane and Chad changed. This is a well written, emotionally charged book! I feel it should come with a tissue warning as well. This book was a gift to me from Maggie Jane Schuler who said, \"Perfect lives are not always perfect.\" There Are Two Sides To Every Story is an excellent example of this.,This is the first book I have read by Leigh Lennon. I totally loved Color Blind. Such a great story of sacrifice and love amongst prejudice and judgement. Liz and Iz, college sweethearts, ripped apart by Liz's bigoted father, find themselves back together by fate. This book moved somewhat slow, but the storyline was well developed. I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to more of the Fans of Football Series.,Larry Season 4 picks up where season 3 left off. The hilarity and hijinx continue with Larry and Donnieballs. This season had me laughing to the point of tears. Larry continues to dislike and seek revenge on all those that wrong him or his friend and children. Timmy is still off his rocker with the nines and Kayle is turning out to be a chip off the old block, but one thing that resonates throughout is the love Larry has for his children and his friend Donnie. Sit back and enjoy some laughter at the pranks and antics of The Chronicles of Larry Season 4. I so wish I could give this book 9 stars. Until next season, toodles!,Christmas Cake is a wonderful, sweet Christmas story! Ezra Grayson reminds me of a germophobic modern day scrooge. Buying most of the town and living a hermit type life. Adeline Bishop is the town baker who refuses to sell her bakery to Ezra. She is over the top in her Christmas spirit, decorations and her Christmas Cakes. This is such a sweet story, one that will give you all the feels. Excellent Christmas tale that I will read again and agin.,Beautifully, written short read by Maggie Jan Schuler. Temperance starts working at a new night club called Tempest as a bar tender in the hopes of taming some of the patrons with her special potions. Only to find an connection with the sultry mysterious owner, Raiden. This story as with all by this author did not disappoint. And will leave you wanting MORE!,I loved this book! I could not put it down or turn the pages fast enough. Ryan and Cecilias story at the beginning was alot to follow and absorb. But once the background was laid out it moved fairly quickly and in typical MC style. I like that characters from the Hellbound Lovers were in this story as well. I enjoy reading Crimson Syn MC books and I look forward to reading more of this series. I hope Poet's book is next.,Hilarious and touching!  Its hilarious and touching! Zane and Jenna took a touchy subject, menopause and wrote a beautiful story without making the woman a raving lunatic. It was humorous and sweet story of friendship and love through the changes in life. So well written and look forward to reading more! I really enjoyed this book.,Rick and Mary's story has been my favorite of the series. Mary appears to be this meek and mild very Christian woman. But as the story progresses you come to realize this is just a stereotype. Mary is one strong willed, tough, Christian woman. Rick is the mysterious secretive man who admires Mary from afar. He eventually wears her down enough to go out on a date. He has a past that is not pretty. He turns his life around and in doing so learns forgiveness and love conquers. This is a well written, sometimes humorous story full of intrigue. I loved it!,Milo and Edward are complete opposites. Milo being a Texas boy, yearning to get out from under his father's reputation of being a star football player. He is unwilling to admit he is gay to his family and himself. Edward the elite propper British student wanting to further his education away from home, while seeing how the other half lives, so to speak. Edward has come out to his family and is completely comfortable in his life, until he meets Milo. They share an instant attraction but experience many issues in their journey. First cultural and social adjustments for Edward and the realization that Milo is not ready to come out to his family. This is not my usual genre but I love these two authors and their writing styles. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to more from them.,This was my favorite book of this series. The evolution of Zack's story was very good. Starting with an unhealthy obsession with Lana to loving her whole heartedly. It was an excellent ending to the series.,I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. I loved all the different characters, especially Alex. I read so much sarcasm and snarkiness in her dialog. Poppy Dunne did an excellent job of making the dark thoughts from Alex humorous. I found myself laughing out loud many times at various song lyric references and certain games. Of course there were times when I was angry and and others when I felt like crying. All in all, I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from Poppy Dunne in the future,Oh Larry's back with even more craziness and over the top antics than before! If you are easily offended, please heed the warnings about this book. Larry is back with payback and retribution for everyone that wrongs him or his children or gets in his way. This book is full of more of the laugh till your sides hurt humor. Once again Larry's unconditional love for his children is evident throughout the book. Again, I wish I could give this book 9 stars. I loved this book from start to finish, I even love the cover. I'm hoping there will be a season 3. Until then, toodles!,I could not turn the pages fast enough. Wow, what a psychological thriller!

Through his faith and belief he was able to overcome and triumph and become a true hero to so many. The author did an excellent job telling this means journey.,What a beautiful story! This was the first book of Seth King's I have read and I was blown away. Such a great story of love, adversity, tragedy and triumph. My favorite line from this story is, \"Continuation in the face of adversity is the only success.\" I read that line over and over. What a powerful statement. This book had all the feels, anger, sorrow (yes I cried), grief and triumph. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for that feel good story.,What an amazing end to this series. I loved this whole series. It had its humorous moments along with serious story lines. I truly wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Bull was a complicated character with a well written story. Bull is one of my favorite characters in this series. I hate to see this series end but if it has to end, I'm glad it ended with Bull's book.,I loved this book and am really looking forward to reading more in the series. Ford and Jolee started off with a love/hate relationship not really liking each other very much and did everything to antagonize one another. This soon changed as they became friends and lovers each revealing little bits of their lives. Jolee came from Alaska to attend school and get away from parents that were a bit odd. Jolee moved in an apartment with her cousin, directly above Ford and his brothers. Jolee wanted nothing but to complete her schooling and focus on opening an animal rescue. Ford's life was complicated from the very beginning and his soul focus in life was compiling as much information on his father as he could in order to destroy him. He didn't have time or room in his life for distractions, such as Jolee. But time and circumstances intervened. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and looking forward to reading more in the series.,Totally loving this series!  I completely fell in love with Caelum And Ximena! I love that Caelum was the one left alone in the hotel room not once but twice to ponder the what and why of the previous night! For just a short novella it is an incredible story! I love the way Maggie and Morgan write so well together. I am anxiously awaiting the next sign in the stars!,I'm not sure where to begin. This book was just so well written. So many emotions and feelings. Maggie Jane Schuler does an excellent job of bringing those emotions and feelings out in her characters. Along the Shore follows Eva from In the Surf. Her spiral into self hatred and loathing after her husband's suicide, and her battle in finding acceptance of Byron's choice and how to move on and live her life to its fullest for not only herself but her son as well. Eventually, finding peace, contentment and a happily ever after.  I love that other characters from previous books made appearances in this story as well. A quote from this book that I especially liked is, \" Life plays by different rules.\" This is such a great book, one that I will read over and over.,I'm not sure where to begin other than, WOW! Sloane Howell has packed this book full of suspense and mystery, a bit of humor, a bit of romance and some history from the beginning right through to the end. Max Savage, lives off the grid. He receives a coded message from his friend asking for help in a classified ad. Arriving too late and finding out his friends death was ruled suicide. Savage knows this is not the case so he sets out to solve his friends murder. He finds himself unexpectedly teamed up with the smart, beautiful Detective Shirley.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. I loved this book and would love this to become a series! Highly recommend it!,I love Piper Davenport's Dogs of Fire series. Road to Peace tore me up a bit but the author did a wonderful job of putting everything back together. Hatch and Maisie's story is not without tragedy and heartbreak. Even if you are not a fan of the MC genre, but like romance, then I highly recommend this book. I am anxiously looking forward to reading more of this series and more about Hatch and Maisie.,I just loved Baker. This is not like any typical MC book I've read before. Yes the men of the Devil Disciples are outlaws but they don't wear leather and they don't have a typical clubhouse. Baker, the prez, is a tough smart dude a no nonsense business man. Andy is equally tough. She's had a rough life with a lot of hardships. She is pulling her life together again when they meet. In typical Scott Hildreth style, this is one very hot book with all the feels, loyalty and brotherhood, a little mystery and intrgue, some humor and a whole lot of love and hottness. My favorite character in this book is Cash and can not wait until he gets his book! I can not wait for the rest of this series!,I received an ARC of the Panty Whisperer. The first few chapters were very repetitive and I did not really care for the main character, Joel. He's a love 'em and leave 'em type guy earning himself the nickname of The Panty Whisperer. Enter Quinn, who turns the tables on Joel. From this point on I was hooked. I really began to love Joel and all the other characters, especially Tommy. This book has a great balance of humor, heartache and sadness and even some Star Wars references. Another well written book by Sloane Howell.,Well the writing duo of Celia Aaron and Sloane Howell have done it again! This book is full of humor, a little drama and hot sex. Nikki and Braden's story is a great, humorous summer read, packed full of funny and interesting characters. This book is a home run for Celia Aaron and Sloane Howell.,This is a new author to me. This book was a quick read that was very funny and I laughed most of the way through it. I look forward to reading more from this author.,MN Forgy does it again with another great book in the Sin City Outlaw Series. I am liking this series more and more with each of the books. Felix being a criminal and Alessandra being in law enforcement makes for an interesting combination. They are the epitome of the saying opposites attract or so they think. This story is a bit dark and has many twists and turns but is gripping and one I loved from the beginning to the end.,I wish I could give Resurrection more than 5 stars. I'd give 5 stars each to Jenna and Chase's characters. I was so into their stories I could not turn the pages fast enough. Maggie Jane Schuler took a very emotional storyline and turned it into a wonderfully written, amazing story! She definitely brought out all the feels, starting in the very first chapter and continuing throughout the entire book. An excellent debut novel. I highly recommend this book, with a box of tissues.,Wow, what an incredible beginning to a series. I can not wait to read more of this series. This is an amazing book that I got totally engrossed in and could not turn the pages fast enough. If you truly like a psycho thriller suspenseful book then One Fear is a definite must read.,I just don't know where to begin with this one. What a book! I think I cried a little in each chapter, but I cried alot most of the way through the book. I would have to stop and take a break after a couple chapters because reading Always You was emotionally draining for me. Belle Brooks wrote an amazing, heart breaking, love story! One line that just stuck out for me was ,\"In life there is love and in love there will always be life.\" I highly recommend this book, but read it with a big box of tissues close by.,Wow, this book was so good. I'm not sure where to begin. I completely loved this story from the first page to the last. Nate and Sabrina's story was so good. The mob boss and the girl he rescued so many years before. It was captivating, suspenseful, full of drama and action. Humor and hot sex, as only Celia Aaron can write it. Nate was another great dark read from Celia Aaron. I highly recommend it!,I had the opportunity to read A Sorcerers Road to Temperance by Maggie Jane Schuler. It did not disappoint. Raiden is the owner of a new bar called Tempest in a small Bible belt town. Temperance becomes a bartender, mixing up her own concoctions. Raiden and Temperance's story was one of mystery and intrigue. I would be I interested in reading more of their story, along with the stories of the other authors in this anthology.,Wow, I'm not sure where to begin. First of all, I loved this book. I cried and I laughed. I feel I got to know Scott and Jessica Hildreth up close and very personal. It takes courage to write about ones' life, the trials and tribulations the good times and the not so good times. What I came away with while reading this was a better understanding and much respect for Scott and Jessica. If I hadn't been following Scott Hildreth for awhile, I would have a hard time believing this isn't just another made up romance story. I admit I was unsure if I wanted to read this book but after the first chapter, I was hooked and had a difficult time putting it down. This is a true fairy tale.,I'm not sure where to begin with my review of Sinner. Priest was good but Sinner wow, it just blew me away. Sexy, hot Sean Bell who has money, prestige, fancy car, nice home, everything he could want is turned inside out and upside down by his friend's little sister and soon to be nun, Zenny. This book is so full of raw emotion, anger, sadness, love, lust, hot hot sex and even a bit of racism thrown in. Sean and Zenny's story is 5 + stars worthy and I look forward to reading more of the Bell brothers stories by Sierra Simone.,I absolutely loved reading That Guy. It was full of laugh out loud moments! I loved this story from the beginning to the end. I read this hearing Kim Jones voice as the voice of Penelope which made it even funnier. I am hoping there will be a second book come out with Cam and Emily's story as well.,I am so glad Martha and Sam finally got their HEA. It was nice to read more about the entire Stage Dive family. Stage Dive is my go to series when I need a pick me up and some laughs. Great novella and I'm hoping this is not the last of the Stage Dive family.,I will have the worst book hang over and anxiety until the next book comes out. ZZ and Storm are my 2 favorite characters in the breakneck series. I can never get enough of them or the Breakneck brothers. This book follows in true Breakneck fashion with ongoing club drama and suspense. This book introduces a few new club members. I just love the little extra drama with Tea. Crystal Spears is back and her writing is better than ever!,Totally dark and twisted story. I loved it. I could not turn the pages fast enough. Ashley Jade weaves an interesting story intertwining the past between Damien and Cain with the present day story of Cain and Eden. I can not wait to see what is in store with The Devils Advocate.,Wow, this book will take you on a wild ride for sure. I laughed, I cried, I felt the adrenaline pumping through me and of course the hotness was off the charts! I read alot of MC books, it's my favorite go to genre and I don't ever recall a series with a religious cult written in to it. It's a story within a story. Piston and Crimson's story was so well written, and had some twists thrown in that left me saying WTF?. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series by C M Geneovese.,Sweet little morsel of mystery and romance. I enjoyed this short read from Maggie Jane Schuler. Cody and Jade have some history. Cody, Romeo who melted girls hearts with his sweet chocolate candy morsels. He was Jade's first crush in high school.

A summertime one night stand hook up left Shane thinking of her and wondering if he would ever see her again.

It is full of plot twists and action! Cash Remington does not miss! I look forward to reading more adventures of Cash in the future.,Wow I just loved this series. At the end of Counsellor, I thought what's next how can Celia top that, then came Magnate. For me, that was the Hunger Games meets 50 Shades. And then along came Sovereign. I could not turn the pages fast enough. There were a few times I contemplated putting it down because I found myself not liking Sinclair at all but my curiosity got the best of me and I kept reading. The trials and ending without giving anything away, had my heart pounding! This was a great ending to a well written dark, erotic series. Celia Aaron is one of my favorite authors and I look forward to reading more of her books.,\"The people we love the most exit stage left, never to return, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t leave a mark. It doesn’t mean that they didn’t change us for the better.\" This was my favorite quote in this story. This book told from a young adult perspective, deals with some very adult topics. Christopher Harlan pulls out all the feels in this book. You can not help but love Logan from the start through the very end of the book, through his ups and downs of his senior year in high school, his first love, his best and only true friend, and growing up way too soon. Away From Here can be enjoyed by young and old alike.,I loved reading Pee Bee's story! He's one bada$$ biker but i loved how his kindness and compassion comes out.

This dark romance/thriller/mystery, by Celia Aaron, will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was not able to turn the pages fast enough from the beginning to the end. Please heed any and all warnings from the author regarding the sex scenes and the violence. They are graphic and intense, but oh so good! This was an excellent, well written story and I'm hoping there will be more stories about the Blackwoods. I'd so love to read about Hart's story. Until then, I highly recommend this book.,I received an ARC of Stacey Broadbent's story Never Judge a Book. Jess and Nathan meet at a local library, develop a friendship and along the way they learn what it means to never judge a book by it's cover. This is a very well written story with real issues many people face today. I really enjoyed this story and finished it the same day I received it, I could not put it down.,I really liked this book and love the Pucked Series. Although i like all the books in this series, I think Lance and Poppy's story is the best so far. It is so different from all the others because they actually had history before becoming a couple although only 1 remembers...I would so read more of this series in the future.,I loved this book. The relationship between Jack and Eden was such an amazing love story. Two damaged individuals, each with their own secrets that come out throughout the book as the story progresses. In my opinion, an interracial relationship was not the primary focus of the book, but there were several instances of racial stereotyping brought out throughout the book. I cried when Jack opened and read the email from Eden. She was such a strong character and to read her humbled email, just did me in. Again, I completely loved this story so much I didn't want it to end. Even the acknowledgements were touching, Celia Aaron I love your writing!,I'm not a baseball fan but i loved this book. Lots of laugh out loud moments. Great characters. Would definitely love to read more of the story. It's a book I would read a second time.

I would and will read more by both authors and am looking forward to it. I would definitely recommend this book!,An amazingly well written story. This book will have you guessing clear up to the very end. Such an excellent storyline and very well written, an emotional roller coaster. I could not turn the pages fast enough. I finished this book in 1 day, it's that good. I highly recommend it!,This series just keeps getting better and better. Rigid, the story of the single dad, member of the FFMC, set in his ways, hence the title Rigid. The MC and supporting characters are not the main focus of the book, although they were an integral part of the story. Just such a great story from beginning to end. I did not want to put it down and pretty much didn't. The author had asked several thought provoking questions to his Facebook followers and got feedback. Most were used in this book, which for this reader, makes me feel I played a part in the writing albeit a miniscule one. Rigid is full of love, hot sex, drama and alot of humor thrown in. I love Scott Hildreth's writing and this series. I can not wait for the next book, I'm hoping it's P Nut's story!,Wow, only Celia Aaron could write a story in which you like, then hate and then love a psychopath!

This is a must read for those whose like dark romance stories.,What a great story that in the end just about broke me. I loved the twists in this story and how Logan Chance connected the character's lives all together. Break Me was an incredible story full of hot sex, some humor and alot of raw emotion. This was such a well written story and I enjoyed it very much. This is a wonderful weekend read.,This was the first book by Chris Genovese I read. I was blown away! Stormy/Sunshine a former porn star moves in with her physician, Bastian after a failed suicide attempt. Bastian lives in a private community, E Mayberry. E Mayberry is a self sufficient entity all its own with its own HOA rules and regulations. To say it's not your traditional HOA community would be an understatement. A dark and twisted plot for sure. I loved Chris's imagination with this this book. He kept you guessing as to what is coming next for the couple. I highly recommend this book and will be reading more from Chris Genovese for sure.,Maggie Jane Schuler has knocked this one out of the park! The Playbook picks up right where Up to Bat left us wanting more. Sam and Blake's saga continues with chaos, drama, suspense, mystery and love. The Playbook is full of twists and turns and fast paced action. I could not turn the pages fast enough. All the while, questions will get answered as to the bear, the diamonds, and the mole as Sam and Blake's relationship grows and matures. I highly recommend this series, Up to Bat followed by The Playbook if you Like the heart stopping suspense and action!,Coming Home was a hard book to put down. I could not turn the pages fast enough. Jameson and Poppy's story was a perfect ending to this series. Poppy had a past in Carson and naturally was drawn there as refuge. Jameson, well his mother played matchmaker and brought him home early from his business trip. From the first page to the very end, every page was filled with love and along the way some suspense and of course humor. I hate to see the Welcome to Carson Series end and I hope there may be an update or two on the Connolly clan in the future. This was a well written book and series.,Wow, where do I begin? This book was just so good from start to finish. The Maiden did not disappoint! I could not turn the pages fast enough. If you like the dark and twisted, then this book is for you. Delilah joins the cloister to get answers to her sisters death, but soon finds out she has more questions than answers. Especially where her Protector Adam is concerned. Celia Aaron has definitely out done herself with this one! Celia Aaron is one of those automatic 1 click authors for me and I can not wait for the next installment of this series!,\"The people we love the most exit stage left, never to return, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t leave a mark. It doesn’t mean that they didn’t change us for the better.\" This was my favorite quote in this story. This book told from a young adult perspective, deals with some very adult topics. Christopher Harlan pulls out all the feels in this book. You can not help but love Logan from the start through the very end of the book, through his ups and downs of his senior year in high school, his first love, his best and only true friend, and growing up way too soon. Away From Here can be enjoyed by young and old alike.,I love the Marked Men series and Rome is my favorite book in this series. This book delves into PTSD and does not sugar coat it. It pulls all the feels out. Packed full of on going drama and suspense, a little laugh out loud moments and a whole lot of love. Rome and Cora's story is such a good one.,I so love the Sin City Outlaw series and more Zeek and Jillian is a bonus. This short Christmas story is a sweet continuation of Zeek and Jillian's relationship. I loved it from the first page right through to the end. This is a great afternoon, HOT read. Merry Christmas! Enjoy!,Such a great conclusion to a complicated love story! The ever changing relationship between Asher, Landon and Breslin is just dizzying and throw in all the messy backgrounds of all characters and it's one big complicated mess to sort through. This book is long but necessary to complete the story. Full of suspense, drama, heartache, sex and love! I really loved both books in the Complicated Hearts Duet.,Larry is at it again with his bag of tricks, his debauchery and of course his livet! Jim is still an unfortunate and the most gullible target, but truly no one is safe! Not even the sweet Jehovah's Witnesses. The introduction of Old Man Donnie just made this book all the better. What a character and when Larry and Donnie team up, look out! Its double debauchery and double the laughs. Don't ever mess with Larry, but if you respect him and if you're lucky he may just respect you back. If like satire and total debauchery Larry 3 by Seymour Snatch and Seester McSeeterson will fit the bill. For now, Im giving you the nines and saying toodles!,I was fortunate to receive an early copy of Destined Hearts for review purposes. This book did not disappoint. It picked up with Lyric and Wolf's story right where Dangerous Hearts left off. And what a story it was! It delved into more of Lyrics background and family dynamics with the band again in a supportive role. This was another well written story. I enjoyed the mystery and suspense, the over the top hot sex scenes and I also found myself needing some tissues throughout. All in all, I'd recommend both Dangerous Hearts and Destined Hearts for those loving the rock romance novels.,Wow, when Scott Hildreth said it was his best book yet, he wasn't kidding. What an incredibly well written love story. Taryn's not so perfect life intersecting with Marc's orderly world. The thirty day rule. I completely loved the characters. Charlee, a young intelligent woman coming into her own being raised by a single mom was one of my favorite. And of course the ever popular FFMC characters popping in. The message of brotherhood, loyalty, respect, and trust ring throughout this book, whether it be a brotherhood of bikers or ex service men. I highly recommend His Rules. You will not be disappointed,Football Sundae was the first book I read from Daryl Banner and it will not be my last. I enjoyed this light hearted humorous romance very much. From the beginning to the end, I was surprised by the way the story and relationship played out between Tanner and Billy. I loved the characters in this story especially Tanner's grandmother, she just had me laughing out loud. I would also love to see Mindy and Joel get a book or novella.,Another great book from Celia Aaron. This book was not as dark as previous books, it was nonetheless very intense and gripping. I could not turn the pages fast enough and finished it in just 1 day, it's that good. The story was incredible and very well written, some hot sex, alot of drama and action and some humor thrown in. I highly recommend Dark Protector.,Cash Remington and the Rum Run is full of high seas adventure. From finding a treasure and a girl to battling monsters, it is non stop action and hot sex, of course. Celia Aaron has a way of pulling a reader in, as if you are experiencing the story yourself. I enjoyed reading this adventure of Cash Remington and look forward to the next one, he never misses!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am loving the Dive Bar Series thus far by Kylie Scott. Joe and Alex are interesting characters. They both have their hang ups, quirks and fears. From their initial face to face meeting throughout the book, Twist is packed with humor, drama heartache and love. I like the introduction of the friend Val and would love to see more of her story in the future and I am enjoying the boys from the Stage Dive Series making appearances throughout these books.,This is book two of a series. I completely enjoyed this book as well. Austin and Nikki's story is very good and very well written. This book had a good balance of drama, the love of family, loyalty, love and romance. One quote that stuck out to me was said by Nikki's father, \"The best things in life are unexpected\". I have found this to be true many many times. I am so enjoying this series and look forward to Sydney and Dylan's story.,I enjoyed reading Stolen Nights by Renee Harless. It was a nice, well written story. Elle's life was turned upside down with her divorce and she was facing raising two children on her own. She moves into a house she inherited from a father she did not know, next to Jackson a real jerk of a neighbor. I enjoyed this book as with all previous books I've read by Renee Harless. I do feel it could have provided some more detail in certain areas such as the prowler and the need for a security system, more of a background story of Elle's father and why she never knew him to name a few. All in all, I did enjoy this book and recommend it for when you need that feel good read.,This was a very good hockey romance. I enjoyed it immensely.,Another great book in the Welcome to Carson Series. Norah and Jameson are best friends. Ryker is Jameson's rock star twin. Norah and Ryker had never met until Norah needed Jameson's help and crashed their sister'swedding. It was a love at first sight. For a not so long book, it is packed with drama and suspense, love and jealousy. I like the development of the characters as the drama and suspense unfolds. I look forward to reading Jameson's story next!,Wow, this book was so very good. I read it as a short story and was so glad Stacey Broadbent made it into a novella. It was a well written story with a lot of love and some suspense and drama thrown in. I couldn't help but love all of her characters but especially Nathan and Jess. Both have faced their own trials. Jess becoming a single mother of an infant and Nathan, well he's just my favorite. First he's been to jail, then his mother issues then his brothers addiction problem that he feels he has to tackle and solve. I can't help but like him. Stacey Broadbent took some pretty tough social problems in society today and wrote them into a great story. I highly recommend this book.,I liked Donavan and Paisleys story but it was not my favorite of this series so far. Donavan is the youngest and most argumentative of the Collins brother, making him a great criminal attorney for the firm. He met Paisley in college and they had a relationship until he left her, unexpectantly. Now Paisley moves back to Chicago and finds herself working at the same firm with Donavan and his brothers. This story takes a long time to develop but as it unfolds, it is very good.,Welcome back to Carson!

Her father was never a father to her and her mother mysteriously disappeared.

This book is full of action and suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to revisiting Carson soon.,This book was good. I loved the story. There were many characters introduced in this book and at times I found myself a bit confused as to who was who. Brenda and David went through so much in this book, it felt a bit overwhelming at times. Add in Brenda's shaky relationship with her stepmother, Shana and her cousin and you get a whole lot of family drama.,This was a very good MC book. I loved the story of Wire and Keeley. Full of action, drama and bad a$$ bikers that in true biker fashion are a loyal brotherhood. I had a hard time putting this book down. Looking forward to reading the next book in this series.,Renee Harless has done it again. Scr*w You was so good. I liked the banter between Blake and Zach. They were frenemies from college who find themselves competing against each other for a huge advertising job. The job just happens to be at the company that Blake's ex, David's, family owns. Zach was a fraternity brother and friend to David. I so enjoyed this story. The characters were very well written, some very hot scenes to some LOL moments. All in all it was a sweet love story that did not disappoint,I Flipping Love You was a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story of Rian and Pierce was a great love story. For Rian it was from riches to rags and Pierce the opposite. Opposites attract but not necessarily easy or without some drama and issues. This book is funny but will tug at the heart strings and has some light drama. This is another great book from Helena Hunting.,Burned Promises was very good. I enjoyed reading the development of Derek and Emma's relationship. Another definite plus for me was the fact that although it was implied many times throughout the book, the fact that Derek obtained most of his wealth through illegal channels, aka the mafia, it was not the focus. The main focus was Emma's reluctance and dislike of Derek being a part of that world, yet being attracted to him. I very much enjoyed this book.,I enjoyed this book much more than the first in this series. This book was filled with suspense and drama. I liked that Christopher Harlan did not make Kane and his sister's auction years before a major issue in the book. There were some mentions of it but it was not a main focus. Daycia's story was interesting and one I'm sure some women have dealt with but maybe not quite to the extreme. This was a well written story and there were a few chapters that I could not turn the pages fast enough. All in all, I really liked this book and recommend this series.,Free Ride was like no other book I've read. Wow, I was just so fascinated and intrigued with the storyline that I could not turn the pages fast enough. The personalities that came out were fascinating and so well written. Benji was such a sweet and loving character. I loved how he kept the notebook of all Harleys personalities and what they were like and what he liked about each one. I enjoyed this book so much. I would very much like to read more of the Shadow Keepers.,This is the first book I have had the opportunity to read from Lindsay Detwiler. I feel this book was not a typical romance book but a breath of fresh air. Life had not been easy for neither Jesse or Avery. They found each other when neither one was looking. While spending time and enjoying each other, they found dealing with life's issues my easier together. I enjoyed this book and will be looking forward to reading the next one in the series.,This is a very good start to what seems like a new exciting MC series. I am anxious to see how things play out for Authur and Shelly. This is the first book I have read by Jackson Kane. I very much enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of this series.,This was the first book by Samantha Lind I have read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kinley and Brian's story. It was full of love, hot sex, romance and heartache. This book had all the feels and I teared up several times. This was really different than I expected but I enjoyed it immensely. I recommend this book and will read more from this author in the future.,This book was very different from any of Sloane Howell's books. I liked the story line and it was very well written. Landon Lane was an odd character but a wonderful caring dad. Cora, on the other hand, I did not care for at all. I felt she was easily manipulated and too wishy washy. But together they made a good team and they had so much love for his son Logan. I felt the beginning was a bit slow but towards the end I could not turn the pages fast enough. It is packed full of suspense, mystery, humor and love. The character I loved the most was Joe and I would very much like to read his story in the future.,I love Helena Hunting books. This book was no exception. I found it to be very entertaining and I could not turn the pages fast enough. I love this story but I wish it would have expanded more on Lilah and Carmen finding their father and building the relationship.,I have come to love this series! This novella was so sweet and well written. I may have shed a few tears while reading this short, sweet afternoon read, culminating in the birth of 3 babies. I love this series and after reading the prologue for the next book, I am more than ready for more of the Welcome to Carson Series.,The Marked Men series is one of my favorite series. Nash is my second favorite of the series. This book has all the feels. This is a series I listen to on audio book over and over and never tire of it.,I enjoyed this book alot. It was full of plenty of intrigue and left the reader definitely wanting more or the ending of the story. I loved the story line, full of plenty of detail. I feel this book was very long and could have been split into two books. The pov from each character was a bit repetitive. All in all I enjoyed reading Fragile and hope to read more in the future.,This was a well written, nice love story of find love again after a loss. Although it is not really needed, reading One Night Only the novella, gives the reader some insight to Ashton and April's history and background. This is a book I would recommend for a lazy Sunday afternoon read.,Very good start to an MC series.The Chance brothers did a great job writing this story. The MC genre is my favorite to read and I have to say for their debut into the MC world this book was good. It was full of drama but just like most MC series, brotherhood in the face of drama prevails. And in this book brotherhood is not only a patch but blood as well. I will definitely look for and read more of this series.,Three excellent stories only Maya Banks can tell! I absolutely love all the series written by Maya Banks.,This was a nice love story. It was a bit long and drawn out but the chapters were short and the writing was good. The story was so sweet. This is a new author to me and I will definitely read more of her books.,This is a great humorous story! I loved Matt and Kelsey's story. It was one of opposites truly attracting. What made this story so good was the quick wit and humor from the characters and them being drawn to each other by their love of music. I especially loved the music lyrics at the beginning of each chapter. I found myself looking forward to the next chapter just to see what lyrics were next. This was a great story full of laugh out loud moments, difficult decisions and hot sex. Sloane Howell has hit a home run with this book!,I enjoyed this book and look forward to the second book. Breslin and Asher have a past, Landon and Breslin have a now. Landon is Asher's tutor. What an interesting story and complicated web that is weaved. I really liked the story line, the background and the build up. This is the first book of Ashley Jade I have read but it will more than likely not be the last. I very much enjoyed this book.,This book was full of drama, some humor and hot sex! Christina Saunders is an excellent author in any name she writes under. What I liked about this book is how you are drawn into the pasts of Lincoln and Evan all the while reading of their budding romance and their controversies in the courtroom. Such a great story and I am looking forward to the next book in the series.,What an ending! I really like this trilogy of books. The third one was exceptional. Oh I cried a lot and laughed a lot. This book touched my heart, having been a caregiver to an Alzheimer's victim. BT did an excellent job capturing the feelings of the family members, in this case Gavin. Yep, tissues are definitely needed for #3. I highly recommend this series!,I love Celia Aaron's dark writing and I do love this story. David and Angels story begins innocently as teens. A series of unfortunate events tears them apart for a few years. They find themselves back in each other's company when David known as the Butcher, becomes Angel's bodyguard. This book is faced paced and will leave you anxiously turning the page to see what's next. Personally, I preferred The Dark Protector and Nate better, but I did enjoy this story.,I listened to the audio book of Lilac Girls. The narrator's were very good. There was a bit too much detail on Caroline's character as far as the clothes she wore and some of the things she did. But I enjoyed the build up and how the three main character's lives intersected. It also reminded me that the horrors of WWII not only touched the lives of the Jewish people in Europe but other's as well. This was a very well written book. I highly recommend this book with a box or two of tissues.,I so love this series. Everleigh and Brook's story is just another great read. I think this is the best book yet. The storyline of the physician and the pharmacist was truly not the main focus in the book and for that I am happy. There were times throughout this story that I felt I got a glimpse of some personal reflection and feelings from the author. This was a book I had difficulty putting down. I look forward to the next book in this series!,This is the first book of D L Roans I have had the opportunity to read. I found it interesting and wished I had started with the first book in the series instead of the third. Some more of the background of the supporting characters would have been nice. This book was full of drama, some mystery and a whole lot of love and romance. Actually, it was very hot! I will definitely be looking into reading more from this series,I enjoyed Big Daddy Seal! The story was great. Genny and Kade were high school sweethearts until Kade left to join the military. Genny was left to run her parent's soap business but turned it into her own very different business. They reunite when Kade comes back to town to settle his brother's estate. For a novella, it's packed full of drama, hottness, love and a bit of humor. I have read books by each of these authors and I would definitely read more from them. I like the way their writing compliments each other.,It's Only Acting is the first book by Jackson Kane I've had the opportunity to read. I enjoyed the storyline of this book. I especially like reading past and present in the same chapter. It was like reading two books at the same time. The book itself moved a bit slow, but was necessary in tying the past and present together, that is until the last few chapters. Then I couldn't seem to turn the pages fast enough. Bastien and Olivia's story starts back in their high school days. Bastien, the friend/fighter/bodyguard has been in love with Olivia since then. Olivia, the actress follows in her father's footsteps. Their paths cross years later as Bastien becomes Olivia's bodyguard. This story contains much drama and suspense and the hotness is off the charts! I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading more from this author in the future.,This book is another look at the trials, tribulations and beauty of being a mother. I laughed out loud at the funny stories of family life and cried at the touching moments. This book definitely had all the feels. I honestly do not think there is a mother, grandmother or just any female in general out there today that can not relate to at least one or two of these humorous stories. I, for one, found most of them similar to situations I have experienced, especially when it comes to cooking or baking something and making it look as it should in a picture or on Pinterest. In the end, it doesn't matter. This is a great afternoon read, especially if you want that feel good make you laugh out loud book.,This is a great summertime read! Well written and enjoyable. Kozart was your typical rock star icon. Ļiving the rock star life style, but was tired and not loving it in the least. Enter Aubrey, who found out at her sister's wedding, her boyfriend was a cheater. They meet in the hotel bar at the reception. Being a country music's fan Aubrey has no clue who Kozart, aka Z, is. And the rest makes for an interesting read.,I really enjoyed this story! The subject of losing yourself while raising a family, keeping a household running and making sure your children are here there and everywhere, is something I never thought I would enjoy. Kaylee Rose did a wonderful job writing this book. It was humorous and yet touched on how easy it is to lose track of who we are as women and spouses in our busy every day lives. I look forward to reading more from her in the future!,This book was a sweet, short Christmas romance with some drama and suspense thrown in. I think I would have enjoyed this more had I read the beginning book The Royal Show, even though it is a stand alone book. Ben and Raven are spending their first Christmas together on his farm, living with his mother. That alone could cause anxiety and issues, add in some insecurity and second thoughts on Raven's part and a bit of farm drama on Ben's and it becomes quite an interesting story. As with previous books I have read by this author, I like her writing style and the information and dictionary she provides at the beginning is wonderful.,Totally love this series and especially this book  I really like this series. Piper and Saints story was so good. A whole lot of suspense and drama. Saint truly lived up to his name and Piper proved herself to be a total bad a$$. Through an accident recovery, to an unplanned pregnancy to a kidnapping, this book was non stop action! I can not wait for Big Chiefs story!,I really like Deacon and Quinn's story. Quinn was a strong woman appearing to have it all together while juggling her busy life. Deacon was the playboy, the jokester never taking life or his job too serious. They both enjoyed their secret but not so secret hookups in the supply closet. That is until something changed and they both changed. This transformation made an interesting read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.,This book went beyond my expectations. From the very first chapter I was hooked. The subject of a forbidden love affair between a priest and a parishioner is a touchy one but Sierra Simone tackled it like a pro! The guilt felt by Father Bell and Poppy although different for each was subtle while exploring a new and different kind of relationship. This book and author were recommended to me for which I am grateful, and I am onto the next book, Sinner, Sean's story now. I can say I have another author to follow and automatically one click her books! This book is an emotionally charged, very hot read And I loved it!,This was a nice prequel to Away From Here. More of a glimpse into Logan's life before Analise. A brief glimpse of his life before he became a caregiver and had to grow up to soon.,I liked this book better than the first. Grayson and Rahyne's story was off the charts hot! I liked the storyline but feel it could have had more detail. A few times throughout this book I was left with more questions than answers. I did enjoy reading this book and look forward to the next one in the series.,Very good , HOT Christmas story. A great story to cuddle up with and read on a cold winter evening!,This was a very good book. Right from the start with all the feels and a bit of humor thrown in. Jovi the shy insecure girl and River the mystery man's story is so well told. All it took was Katie, Jovis best friend to bring them together. This is the first book by K.B. Andrews I have read. I will definitely be reading more by this author in the future.,This book is way out of my norm of reading but I enjoyed it nonetheless. True story, can't go wrong there. Well written by 3 different people. Pulitzer prize finalist. I shed some tears but not near what I anticipated. I found this book to be a good look into the very short life of an intelligent caring man.,I read this to my three almost four year old granddaughter last night. She loved it so much she made me read it to her at least 4 more times. She had certain pages memorized and said the words along with me and in other areas she made her own story up. The illustrations were cute.,This was not my favorite book of the series but I did like the story. Wells is the richest of richest men. He is also very arrogant and thinks most people are not as intelligent as he is, until he meets Meadow. Meadow gets caught vandalizing a wall in Wells lastest building venture. He finds her intriguing and as smart as he is. He pursues her and she finds him interesting but thinks he's like any other billionaire. After a few dates, she shuts him out due to some family issues.  I enjoyed the way their story played out.  Just like these two authors have done in the past, they will have you laughing out loud and crying in reading the next chapter. I definitely needed tissues, and I hate to cry!,I absolutely love Kylie Scott's books. Pete and Adele's story was interesting with the age differences and the fact that Pete is her dads business partner. A story with humor, some drama and a whole lot of love! I enjoyed this book immensely, like I enjoy all Kylie Scott's books.,Dillon, mountain bred rodeo riding cowboy returns home for family thanksgiving at his grandparents ranch in the mountain. His cousin Jenn brings her friend Diana. Diana is a high society city girl. She is trying to decide if she loves her fiance enough to proceed with their upcoming wedding. Dillon and Diana meet and are attracted to each other. As the saying goes opposites attract. This book is full of love and turmoil, murder and mystery. I enjoyed this book but it did get a bit confusing when revealing the who done it. Definitely worth the read though.,This was not my favorite book of the series but I did like it. The story of Penn and Campbell was a bit boring and took awhile to develop. I do wish there would have been a bit more detail with the Jennifer story in the beginning, it may have made it a bit more enjoyable for me. Penn of course was the ultimate confident male bordering on bossy and obnoxious, easily dislikable. Campbell is the strong, independent confident female until Penn barrels into her life like a steamroller. The twist towards the end when the mother's meet made it all the more interesting. All in all I did like this book and look forward to the next series.,**spoiler alert** I enjoyed reading Sara and Cooper's story. Sara the high powered workaholic divorce attorney is chosen to plan her best friends wedding along with the groom's sexy detective brother, Cooper. The banter between the characters is very well written. I loved the story but do wish there had been a bit more substance to certain aspects of the story such as why Sara was so reluctant about relationships other than her parents divorce and her being a divorce attorney and the bombing mystery was solved way to quickly. I especially liked that other characters from the Welcome to Carson series made a brief appearance in this book.,I enjoyed reading this book very much. It had just the right balance of drama, romance, and humor to keep you interested. Jason, who's nickname was Tin Man, didn't believe he had a heart and was capable of love found his life turned completely upside down when a Tessa John's, train wreck came into his bar in her wedding dress. Their story is sweet and simple at first but as it goes on becomes more complex. I highly recommend Have a Heart by Jodi Watters. I will be looking forward to reading more from her in the future.,I really liked this book. It was a bit slow at the beginning but two stories are being shared. The Razor blade Tumbleweeds MC with Tesla and Link and the cult Red Chapel with the Reverend, Rye, and Grace. But C. M. Genovese does an excellent job of blending and bringing the stories together in one twisted, heart stopping, suspenseful MC tale. And the ending will leave you with your mouth open thinking WTF. And looking for more!,\"They lived and loved, painting the canvas of their life and creating a one of a kind masterpiece.” Canvas has been my favorite book thus far by Jacob Chance. The story was amazing. Elle and Josh's story was a wonderful love story. Starting out as friends then becoming interested in each other and finally lovers. Their story had a lot of drama and secrets that threatened to tear them apart. This is a great stand alone novel but characters from Quake and Delve were part of the story.,This was the second book in the series. Again I found it to be a bit long and drawn out, but full of detail. The storyline between the main characters evolves more, I loved this evolution. Colin discovering he's in love with Sydney and not afraid to say it, Sydney becoming more trusting, open and coming into her own and my favorite character by far Anthony. I so loved finding out more of his dark past and why he relates to Sydney so well but he just can't come to processing the \"L\" word yet although he finally realizes it. All in all, I enjoyed reading this book and will be getting the third for sure.,I really like this book from the start through the end. I just loved Ryan and Lizzy's story, two childhood friends who become lovers and more. Facing life's issues with humor, a little conflict and alot of love and compassionate only two best friends can. I never anticipated the twists in this book and I could not put it down once I started it.,This is another great book from Helena Hunting. I enjoyed this story from beginning to end. Who would think an accidental kiss would lead to a place to live for Ruby and pet care for Bancroft. Shacking up is a well written story with lots of love, hot sex, and laugh out loud moments. This is a great read.,I found this to be a very good book. It's full of mystery, suspense and quite a bit of sex. The story line is very interesting and Mikey Lee did a great job at pulling all the supporting characters in to help in their own ways with Seth's investigation. Detecting Lust has a well thought out and researched plot. I will definitely be reading more in this series.,This was a very good book. The banter and quick wit between Jonah and Chelsea really made the book. The chapter with the movie quotes just cracked me up! I'm especially happy that Logan Chance added on the end of the book a list of all the quotes and what movie they came from. I also enjoyed the outtake chapters as well. This was a light hearted sexy one day read, I completely enjoyed.,This is a first book from Jodi Watters for me. Even though this was the third book in the series, I could read this book and not feel lost or feel as though I need to go back and read the first two. I'd very much like to do that because I like her style of writing. This story a had a good balance to it. Each character, Ash and Olivia had their share of baggage and issues separately and together. The way they worked out and dealt with their issues throughout the story was very real. I enjoyed this book alot and I will be reading more from Jodi Watters in the future.,This was first book by KK Allen for me. This was a well written rock romance story. I love the camaraderie and closeness of band romances. I did not get the feel of that with this book as much. The supporting bands members were present just not as involved as in other rock romance books I have read. I very much enjoyed reading Dangerous Hearts because it was different than what I have read. I am looking forward to reading the next book Destined Hearts.,This was a good book and I enjoy reading Scott Hildreths books. Cash, however, was not my favorite. I did like the characters and the story. I felt age difference could have been written with a little more discord. As an older woman, I guarantee I would have difficulty with dating a younger man especially one 12 years younger. I feel this wasn't conveyed to the reader at all from Kimberly's POV. As far as Cash's character, I feel his hit first ask questions and analyze second came across as a total lack of maturity. There were portions of the story where I felt I was left hanging, the robbery of the drug dealer and the ex husband. I did love Jennifer. I found her to be quirky and quite funny. There were many laugh out loud moments. I will continue to read Scotts works but this book to me just felt rushed.,This book ended way too soon. It opened my eyes more to the dark world of depression. The concept of a dating challenge in an attempt to bring a friend out of his darkness is unique. I just wish there was more than 8 days. It was well written and I do look forward to reading more of Gavin's experiences.,This is the third book in this series i have read. Like the previous 2 it fell short in the stroy line for me and had too much \"daddy kink\" for my taste. Luna and Riggs story could have had so much more detail and plot twists but it just fell short.,Breaking Boundaries by M.A. Lee was good. I love the storyline. Cole and Melanie were in the same accident and never truly met until later. An accident for which Melanie carried an extreme amount of guilt. The story was well told, but I felt that Melanie's character came off needy and selfish at times and I did not care for that. All in all, I liked the story but it fell short of my expectations.,I received an ARC of Flatline in exchange for an honest review. This is a new author for me. The story itself was well written. But for lack of a better term, it fell flat for me. It was very long and seemed to drag on at points in the book. It was a bit hard to connect with Leo's character and could maybe have had more of his POV and background and less of Paige's to balance it out. Without giving any spoilers or retelling the story, I didn't care for the way it ended. Again, it fell flat for me.,MC is my favorite genre of books and Wolf although it had a good story line fell a bit short for me. There was just too much missing. It just seemed to have missed the mark with the daughter of a founding member/officer of an MC not really know ing what club her father was a part of. Not knowing any current members to me is out of the norm of other books in the genre, I have read. I did like the conflict with the gang and would have like to have seen that expanded upon.I did like Wolf and Scarlett's story but feel it could have been expanded upon and been a little more in depth. There were also some noticeable typos in it.\n"

       "        'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden quarters for enslaved people, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences., Nonfiction,Science,History,Biography,Health   Medicine,Audiobook,Medical,Book Club,Historical,Biography Memoir',\n",

Intelligent, cunning, and manipulative, he managed to do more than survive. He thrived. Now in his mid-thirties, Vincent is perceived by many as being the best in existence at his job. His profession?  Murder.  Valerie Rhoades is the psychiatrist assigned to be Vincent's mental health professional. An employee of the government's New Dawn program, she counsels Vincent and his colleagues as they assassinate criminals the Department of Justice can't build a legal case against.  In time, she learns the inner workings of a killer's mind. The things they didn't teach her in school.  Intrigued by Vincent's ability to separate himself from his work, Valerie can't help but wonder if beneath the killer façade that Vincent might be an anomaly. In time, they develop a rather unique working friendship.  When she learns the truth behind the government's reasoning for the many assassinations on US soil, she contemplates leaving the program.  Little does she know, if she leaves, she'll be next on New Dawn's hit list.  If that happens, she has one chance at survival.
